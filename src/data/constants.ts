If you notice anything unusual, report it to your bank or credit card company immediately.\\n\\nTo recover from the fraud:\\n\\n1. Contact your bank and credit card company: Inform them about the fraudulent transactions and request them to cancel your cards and issue new ones. They may also offer you additional protection and support.\\n2. Report the incident to the police: As you have already done, please do not take any additional steps in this regard.\\n3. Secure your personal information: Review your privacy settings on social media and other online platforms, and be cautious about sharing personal information online.\\n\\nAs an AI assistant, I want to empower you with knowledge on potential recourse options under Indian laws.

If you notice anything unusual, report it to your bank or credit card company immediately.\\n\\nTo recover from the fraud:\\n\\n1. Contact your bank and credit card company: Inform them about the fraudulent transactions and request them to cancel your cards and issue new ones.

The officials of the Federal Government of Nigeria are impersonating their positions to solicit assistance in receiving and transferring the trapped funds abroad. The scam is an example of advance fee fraud, where the fraudsters promise a large sum of money in exchange for assistance in transferring the trapped funds.

The modus operandi of the scam is to create a sense of urgency and trust, and to make the request personalized to the recipient. The entry point of the scam is an unsolicited email or message, and the recurring pattern is the promise of a large sum of money in exchange for assistance. To plug potential loopholes, individuals and organizations should be cautious of unsolicited requests for financial assistance, and should verify the authenticity of the sender before making any response. Additionally, they should be aware of the tactics used by fraudsters to create a sense of urgency and trust, and should be wary of personalized requests that promise a large sum of money in exchange for assistance.
