## Some sample questions and responces:

Question: should i share otp over call?

Responce: ```Hello! Sharing an OTP (One-Time Password) over a call is not recommended for security reasons. Here's why:

1. Unsecured communication: Calls are not inherently secure, as the conversations can be easily intercepted by unauthorized parties. This means that the OTP could be compromised, and your personal information or account could be accessed without your permission.
2. Lack of confirmation: When sharing an OTP over a call, there is no way to confirm that the receiving party is genuine or authorized to access your account. This can lead to identity theft or unauthorized access to your personal information.
3. Vulnerability to eavesdropping: If the call is not secure, there is always a risk of eavesdropping, which can result in the OTP being intercepted or compromised.

To avoid potential security risks, it's recommended to use secure channels for sharing OTPs, such as SMS or email. These channels offer a higher level of security and confirmation of the receiving party's identity. However, if you must share an OTP over a call, make sure to use a secure line and confirm the identity of the receiving party before sharing the code.

In summary, it's not advisable to share an OTP over a call due to security risks. Instead, opt for more secure channels like SMS or email for sharing OTPs. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!```
