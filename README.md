## Some sample questions and responces:

Question: should i share otp over call?

Response:
```
Hello! Sharing an OTP (One-Time Password) over a call is not recommended for security reasons. Here's why:

1. Unsecured communication: Calls are not inherently secure, as the conversations can be easily intercepted by unauthorized parties. This means that the OTP could be compromised, and your personal information or account could be accessed without your permission.
2. Lack of confirmation: When sharing an OTP over a call, there is no way to confirm that the receiving party is genuine or authorized to access your account. This can lead to identity theft or unauthorized access to your personal information.
3. Vulnerability to eavesdropping: If the call is not secure, there is always a risk of eavesdropping, which can result in the OTP being intercepted or compromised.

To avoid potential security risks, it's recommended to use secure channels for sharing OTPs, such as SMS or email. These channels offer a higher level of security and confirmation of the receiving party's identity. However, if you must share an OTP over a call, make sure to use a secure line and confirm the identity of the receiving party before sharing the code.

In summary, it's not advisable to share an OTP over a call due to security risks. Instead, opt for more secure channels like SMS or email for sharing OTPs. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!

Question: is gift card official way to pay my taxes

Responce:
```
Hello! I'm here to help you with any questions you may have about cybersecurity, Indian cyber laws, and fraud detection. However, I must inform you that using a gift card as an official way to pay your taxes is not a recommended or legal practice in India.

The Indian government has established strict laws and regulations for tax payments, and there are specific ways to make tax payments. These include online payment methods such as the Income Tax Department's e-filing website, or offline methods such as visiting a local tax office or using a tax consultant.

Using a gift card to pay taxes may seem like a convenient option, but it is not a legitimate or secure method for several reasons:


1. Lack of documentation: Gift cards typically do not provide a receipt or documentation of the transaction, making it difficult to prove that you have paid your taxes.
2. Security risks: Gift cards can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks, which could result in your sensitive personal and financial information being compromised.
3. No traceability: Gift cards do not provide a traceable record of the transaction, making it challenging to track your tax payments or verify that the payment was received.

## Backend

### Spring Boot

The backend of this project is built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It provides a robust and flexible framework for building Java-based enterprise applications.

### JWT Authentication

We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It's commonly used for securing communication between a client and a server.

### Database

#### MongoDb

The project uses a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data. PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database system known for its reliability and performance.

#### Dockerized Database

The PostgreSQL database is containerized using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), making it easy to manage and deploy across different environments.

## Frontend Web Portal

### Typescript in Next Js Framework

The project utilizes TypeScript seamlessly with Next.js, a React framework, to enhance the project with code quality, and improved developer experience by leveraging TypeScript's type checking and Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities in a seamless integration for building robust and scalable web application.
